# Assume that we added a constraint with the script:
	#ALTER TABLE film
	#ADD CHECK (length>=10);
#Now we would like to delete it. To do so we need to run the following script:
	#ALTER TABLE film
	#DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
#But we are missing the constraint name. What query can we run to get the film table constraintâ€™s names?
